# DAA-FINAL-LAB
Exam-oriented C++ implementations of core algorithms commonly asked in Algorithms Lab ESA. The focus is on clear logic, short and readable code, and easy execution for academic labs and viva. Designed for small inputs without advanced STL or optimizations.

# Algorithms Lab – ESA (C++)

This repository contains simple and exam-oriented C++ implementations of
commonly asked algorithms in the Algorithms Lab End Semester Assessment (ESA).

The programs are written with the following goals:
- Easy to understand
- Short and readable code
- Suitable for lab execution
- Focused on core algorithm logic

---

## Algorithms Included

- Brute Force String Search
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Floyd’s Algorithm
- Binary Search Tree (Insert, Delete, Traversal)
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Kruskal’s Algorithm
- Prim’s Algorithm
